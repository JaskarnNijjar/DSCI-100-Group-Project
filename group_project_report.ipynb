    "Airlines operate within a highly competitive and evolving environment where pricing strategies play a crucial role in attracting customers and maximizing profitability. The price of a flight ticket is very important to a consumer, it may determine which company they fly with or whether they fly at all. Consumers have different wants and needs when it comes to which flight they take, and airlines price their fares accordingly. Flight fares are influenced by many factors including demand, competition, fuel prices, and operating costs. Airlines invest in and employ revenue management systems that constantly adjust ticket prices based on the current demand and other factors such as: duration till departure, the departure and arrival times themselves, source and destination locations, number of stops in a trip, and the class of the ticket. In our project we will answer the following: Can we accurately and consistently predict the price of a flight ticket based on it's duration till departure, duration of the flight, and class of the ticket (Economy or Business)? To answer this question we will be using a dataset that contains various flights and their details from the website Easemytrip for flights between India's top 6 metro cities. We will be using the cleaned data in which there are 300261 datapoints and 11 categories."

Furthermore, the pricing for business tickets is much higher than economy. This is also our first glimpse of the variability in business pricing, which can be seen from the standard deviations in price. We can attribute the fewer count of business tickets to it's pricing, since the average consumer may not be able to afford or justify spending the premium to fly business, hence setting a lower demand for business tickets. Here we have seperated the data by class using the group_by() function, and we have calculated the minimums, maximums, standard deviations, means using their respective functions."

We have plotted actual prices on the x-axis while plotting the preidcted prices on the y-axis. The idea here is to visually analyze the accuracy of our models predictions. We have used a dashed line with a slope of 1 to indicate perfect predictions. For points that are on this line, the actual price and predicted price are identical hence the model made a perfect prediction. Ideally, we would want as many points as possible to be on or atleast very close to the line.

    "We have concluded that our analysis has produced quite interesting results. From the beginning, in our summarizations we began to see increasing variability in the pricing for business class tickets. This was revealed by the larger ranges in minimum, maximum and standard deviation of pricing, our summarization plots then revealed a substantial lack of consistency, in patterns and correlations compared to economy class tickets. We found a lot more spread and outliers between points. We attribute this to the idea that the business class ticket market has less competition compared to economy tickets. There are a few reasons for this, an initial finding we came across was that from the 6 airlines included in this data set only 2 of them offered business class tickets. Furthermore, they were the 2 largest of all the airlines, since they had the highest flight counts. Since there are less airlines competing to sell business class tickets this allows them to be negligent towards their pricing strategies. The next cause of the variability in business class tickets can be attributed to economic status of their consumers. Typically, these consumers have more money than since they have the ability to spend extra which in return can translate to them being less concerned about pricing and can allow airlines to be more careless regarding their pricing. Our analysis found that we had a very difficult time predicting pricing for business class tickets, while we were fairly successful with economy tickets."

    "We were surprised by the performance of our model. In specific, the model performed worse than we originally expected, we found that the RMSE was almost 7500, which is a larger average magnitude of the error than we would've hoped. We also found that the MAE was nearly 4200, meaning that on average, the model's predictions are about 4200 rupees off from the actual flight fares which is very significant in a model meant to predict pricing. The RSQ measure value at about 0.89 which meant that approximately 89% of the variability in flight prices can be explained by the model, we found this to be a positive since we can attribute the poor performance to incorporated factors. Upon analyzing our results, we concluded that this decline in performance can be attributed to the variability of business class tickets. Evidently, from the 3 analysis plots above we can see a clear pattern in the plotting of economy and business class tickets. Our predictions for economy fares were fairly accurate and we can clearly distinguish from the side-by-side plots that the predictions followed very similar patterns as the actual pricing. Where we believe our model took a hit was with the incorporation of business tickets. Their variabilities and inconsistencies made it difficult for the model to predict pricing, which dropped the performance significantly. It was crucial to plot the results from our model to clearly see where it was going wrong. We found that if we only included economy class tickets our model can be considered strong. Our model can be further improved by incorporating even more predictors which would help the performance for all predictions, another way that it could be improved is by using a larger sample size or the entire data set. The improvement from this would be marginal compared to the improvement from using more predictors."

    "Despite the overall model not being as accurate as we expected, we believe that our model could be impactful if it was narrowed down to only predict pricing for economy class tickets. Airlines could utilize our model to automatically price their tickets based on just some characteristics of the flight itself. Our model is just a start, we use very few predictors and we are limited in the amount of data we can process. Airlines are often worth billions so they have access to the technology and infrastructure required to further enhance a model like this drastically. Our model doesn't have to be useful to only airlines, consumers can find benefit in it as well. A consumer can use our model to find how much the flight they are looking at should typically be priced, they can then use this information to determine whether they are getting a good deal or whether they are overpaying. Despite this model's performance suffering due to the business class tickets, consumers of those tickets can use our model to see what they should be paying for their flights instead of paying any price that the airline is offering their tickets at. At the end of the day everyone would prefer to keep or make more money, making our model an impactful tool to anyone in the airline ticket market."
